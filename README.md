# ML-Identifying-Fraud-from-Enron-Emails-
Identifying Fraud from Enron Emails and Financial Data

* The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can identify persons of interest based on features included in the Enron dataset. Such model could be used to find additional suspects who were not indicted during the original investigation, or to find persons of interest during fraud investigations at other businesses.
* Tested the dataset on algorithms like Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, used
clustering, tuned parameters and compared their performance, precision and recall
